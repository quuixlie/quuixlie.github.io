                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>My history with programming began when I was 11 years old. At that time I bought a book about Java, which I couldn't understand because an error kept popping up during installation. When I was 15 I went back to learning programming, but now in C++.</p>
                    <p>I was motivated to do so by a request from my classmates, who wanted me to write a virus to troll my Russian teacher. That's when I made my first money doing something I really love.  I got about $5, but for me it was enough, because I had a lot of fun while writing that virus. I still remember the fun we had when a classmate sent a message to the teacher to move the car because the delivery guy couldn't enter the school. When she left the classroom we uploaded for her program. The mouse jumped around on the screen, various sounds came out of the speakers, and the keyboard was locked, leaving the teacher completely confused.</p>
                    <p>At the age of 16, I learned college-level math in 6 months. Later, I became interested in AI, making computer games, hacking and electronics. I continued to troll teachers, e.g. by changing the brightness of the projector via LAN, which made one teacher think that the lamp from the projector was starting to die and needed to be replaced with a new one. For another vocational subject teacher I turned off the projector via LAN (For those interested, I obtained the IP by scanning the network, by the way, this is how I discovered the bug in the school network. When I set the scanner to its maximum settings, it would take out the computer network in the classroom. One day I scanned the network in this way for 4h, which caused the teacher to postpone the test for a week, because he could not access moodle, where we were solving tests) by which she thought I had uploaded a virus to her and she started formatting all the drives. I couldn't stand laughing when I heard this ツ</p>
